# PresidentKevvol-s-Multi-layer-perceptron-network
A simple multi-layer perceptron network written in vanilla java

I created this a while back to model some data as a personal project

It's unnecessarily long and not very practical but if you want to use it feel free to download the entire source code, just look into the "tests" package for examples I created myself
